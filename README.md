## :page_facing_up: About
- A basic backend API which allows a front end app to interact with a database.
- Has multiple routes allowing for different features, for example 'get' and 'post' requests.

## :pencil2: Planning & Problem Solving
- I initially planned out 5 tables as shown below, although as I started to create I then realised that I no longer required an admin login table, as no admin login feature was needed, and the class/role tables both only would store a single field, so it would be easier to put that field straight into the guides table.
